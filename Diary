4/23 updated static medium pages (i.e. TV, albums, etc) to include links to articles, but couldn't figure out how to get articles to populate on a static page other than a home page.
This will be an okay alternative though
4/23 now that the home page is populated with articles, I'm also adding/changing the blocks to try to make it look better/explain how to use the site for the user who doesn't know intutively/
4/24 Reviews for Classic Wow and League of legends finished.
